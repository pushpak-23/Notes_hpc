Wireshark capturing modes:
``````````````````````````
Promiscuous mode: 
`````````````````
Sets interface to capture all packets on a network 

Monitor mode:
`````````````
Sets wireless interface to capture all the traffic it can receive [unix/linux only]


Logical operator:
``````````````````
1. and or && : Logical AND [ all the condition should match ]
2. or or ||  : Logical OR [Either all or one should match ]
3. xor or ^^ : Logical XOR [ Exclusive alteration - only one of the two condition match not both]
4. not or ! : Not [ Not equal to ]

Filtering packets [display filter]:
```````````````````````````````````
eq or == : equal [ ip.dst == x.x.x.x ]
ne or != : Not equal [ ip.dst != x.x.x.x ]
gt or >  : Greater than [ frame.len > 10 ]
it or <  : less than [ frame.len < 10 ]
ge or >=  : Greater than or equal [ frame.len >= 10 ]
le or <=  : Less than or equal [ frame.len <= 10 ]

Common filtering commands:
``````````````````````````
Filter by IP:
`````````````
ip.addr == x.x.x.x

filter by dst IP:
`````````````````
ip.dst == x.x.x.x

Filter by source IP:
````````````````````
ip.src == x.x.x.x

Filter by IP range:
````````````````````
ip.addr >= x.x.x.1 and ip.addr <= x.x.x.100

Filter by multiple IPs:
```````````````````````
ip.addr == x.x.x.1 && ip.addr == x.x.x.100

Filter by subnet:
`````````````````
ip.addr == 10.0.0.0/24

Filter by port:
````````````````
tcp.port == 25

Filter by dst port:
`````````````````````
tcp.dstport == 23

Filter by IP addr and port:
```````````````````````````
ip.addr == x.x.x.x and tcp.port == 25

Filter by URL:
``````````````
http.host == "hostname"

Filter by SYN flag:
```````````````````
tcp.flags.syn == 1
tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0
