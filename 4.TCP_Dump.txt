tcpdump is a most powerful and widely used command-line packets sniffer or package analyzer tool which is used to capture or filter TCP/IP packets that are received or transferred over a network on a specific interface.

How to Install tcpdump in Linux
``````````
# apt install tcpdump  [On Debian, Ubuntu]
# yum install tcpdump  [On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora]


1. Capture Packets from Specific Interface
``````````````````````````````````````````
# tcpdump -i ens33



2. Capture Only N Number of Packets
````````````````````````````````````
# tcpdump -c 5 -i ens33






3. Print Captured Packets in ASCII
```````````````````````````````````
# tcpdump -A -i ens33








4. Display Available Interfaces
````````````````````````````````
# tcpdump -D










5. Display Captured Packets in HEX and ASCII
`````````````````````````````````````````````
# tcpdump -XX -i ens33









6. Capture and Save Packets in a File
``````````````````````````````````````
# tcpdump -w 0001.pcap -i ens33









7. Read Captured Packets File
`````````````````````````````
# tcpdump -r 0001.pcap







8. Capture IP Address Packets
``````````````````````````````
# tcpdump -n -i ens33








9. Capture only TCP Packets
````````````````````````````
# tcpdump -i ens33 tcp










10. Capture Packet from Specific Port
`````````````````````````````````````
# tcpdump -i ens33 port 22








11. Capture Packets from source IP
``````````````````````````````````
# tcpdump -i ens33 src x.x.x.x









12. Capture Packets from destination IP
````````````````````````````````````````
# tcpdump -i eth0 dst x.x.x.x











13. Capture all packets in any interface
`````````````````````````````````````````
# tcpdump -i any









14. Capture specific host
``````````````````````````
# tcpdump -i ens33 host x.x.x.x









15. Complex expressions
````````````````````````
# tcpdump -i lo src 127.0.0.1 and port 80


# tcpdump -i lo "port 80 and (src x.x.x.x or src x.x.x.x)"
