System Requirements
--------------------

Architecture:
-------------
1. Install nagios plugins
2. plugins checks the status and get results
3. plugins sends results to Nagios to process
4. Notifies the admin about the status 

NagiosXI core [Manual centos]:
-----------------------
1. yum install epel-release
2. yum repolist
3. yum install nagios httpd php -y
4. htpasswd -c /etc/nagios/passwd nagiosadmin
5. http://localhost/nagios

	username: nagiosadmin
	password: redhat

-> Nagios stat on OS
`````````````````````
# nagiostats

-> Reading configuration data
```````````
# nagios -v /etc/nagios/nagios.cfg

NagiosXI core [VM]: ****MOST PREFERABLE***
-------------------
1. signup & download (.ova)
2. Access URL & setup
3. Setup agent by usign RPM repo [ nagios.org/ncpa ]
4. Run fork bomb to test stress

Monitoring agent for Windows, Linux, and Mac, Cloud, Docker etc...


1) 
CentOS / RHEL / Oracle Agent:
```````````````````````````````
- Install From Nagios RPM Repository  [ CentOS 7/ RHEL 7]
# rpm -Uvh https://repo.nagios.com/nagios/7/nagios-repo-7-4.el7.noarch.rpm  [ ver: 7 ]
# yum repolist
# rpm --import https://repo.nagios.com/GPG-KEY-NAGIOS-V3
# yum install ncpa -y

- Install From Nagios RPM Repository  [ CentOS 9/ RHEL 9]
# rpm -Uvh https://repo.nagios.com/nagios/7/nagios-repo-7-4.el7.noarch.rpm  [ ver: 7 ]
# yum repolist
# rpm --import https://repo.nagios.com/GPG-KEY-NAGIOS-V3
# yum install ncpa -y




Debian:
```````
# apt install apt-transport-https
# Add to the apt sources list
echo "deb https://repo.nagios.com/deb/$(lsb_release -cs) /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nagios.list

# Add our public GPG key
wget -qO - https://repo.nagios.com/GPG-KEY-NAGIOS-V3 | apt-key add -

# Update your repositories
apt-get update
# apt install apt-transport-https [ may be not needed ]
# apt install ncpa -y

2) 
Configuring NCPA
````````````````
+ The NCPA configuration file is located here:

# vim /usr/local/ncpa/etc/ncpa.cfg

community_string = mytoken

Change it to your required token, for example:

community_string = Str0ngT0k3n

+ You will now need to restart the "ncpa_listener" service for these changes to take affect

# systemctl restart ncpa_listener.service
OR
# /etc/init.d/ncpa restart
