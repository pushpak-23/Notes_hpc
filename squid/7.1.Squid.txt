# yum install squid -y
# apt install squid -y


# systemctl restart squid
# systemctl enable squid

To check:
``````````
# squid -k check | echo $?


Port : 3128

# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=squid --permanent
# firewall-cmd --reload


RULE:
`````
http_access: Allows HTTP clients (browsers) to access the HTTP port. This is the primary access control list.

http_reply_access: Allows HTTP clients (browsers) to receive the reply to their request. This further restricts permissions given by http_access.
